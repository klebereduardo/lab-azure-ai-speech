An excellent product, beautiful translation into the desired language during the call, the only thing I don't like are the raise, lower and power off keys, they are too internal for those with large fingers like mine who struggle to use the keys.

Parcel arrived in post already tried...packaging inside broken, wire with plug free and not tied as new products usually are, fryer wrapping put on good with scotch tape and handle broken in 2 pieces. Product paid in full and as new.
